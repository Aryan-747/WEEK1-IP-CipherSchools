    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    <br>
    And sorry I could not travel both
    <br>
    And be one traveler, long i stood
    <br>
    And looked down one as far as i could
    <br>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;
    <br>
    <br>
    Then look the other,as just as fair,
    <br>
    And having perhaps the better claim.
    <br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    <br>
    though as far that passing there
    <br>
    Hard worm them really about the same.
    <br>

    <p>
        And both that morning euqally lay
        <hr>
        in leaves no step had trodden black.

    'The Starlight Night' was
        one of two poems which Hopkins
        sent to his mother as a birthday present,

    The other poem being 'God's Grandeur'
            What a birhtday present!
